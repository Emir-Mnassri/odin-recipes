      <li>
        <b>Onion and garlic </b>
        <p>
          An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons
          of flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tomato products </b>

      </li>
      <li>

          Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
          flavor of the sauce.

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spices and seasonings</b>

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cheeses</b>
        <p>
          Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
          decadent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Egg</b>
        <p>
          An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
          when you cut into it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
